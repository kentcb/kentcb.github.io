Recently I wrote an iOS app using C# and the Xamarin tool chain. In addition, I thought it'd be an interesting exercise to record the design and development of the app as it progressed (silly me - it turned out to be a major undertaking!).

The app is called *Workout Wotch* and its goal is to facilitate working out (duh) without requiring much attention be paid to counting sets and reps and what-not. You basically give it your exercise program and it can play it back to you aurally (and, to a lesser extent, visually).

Anyways, it's kind of a fun code base, using Rx, RxUI, async, PCLMock and what-have-you. Check out the code (and links to videos) on [the Workout Wotch github repo](https://github.com/kentcb/WorkoutWotch).
