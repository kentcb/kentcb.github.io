## Introduction

![Screenshot 1]({{ page.assets }}screenshot1.png "Screenshot 1")

Kentis is a Tetris clone that I wrote back in 2004 whilst in hospital awaiting the birth of my daughter. It is packaged as a single executable that you can [download here]({{ page.assets }}Kentis.zip).

Kentis attempts to remain true to the original game-play, but with an added arcade feel.

If you have any recommendations for how the game can be improved, or if you are able to provide feedback on whether the game works on any additional platforms, please do so in the comments.

## Score System

![Screenshot 2]({{ page.assets }}screenshot2.png "Screenshot 2")

The scoring system in Kentis favors those who place blocks faster, and eliminate more lines in one move.

The descent speed of blocks can be increased by pressing the down arrow. A block can be dropped immediately by pressing the space key. The faster you drop a block, the greater your score will be for that move. And the greater your current level, the greater your score will be.

For example, suppose it takes you 1 second to place and drop a block. If you’re on level 1, you will score 12 points. If you’re on level 2, you will score 15 points. If you’re on level 9, you will score 27 points.

For each block you place, you will get an additional score if you clear rows with that block. When clearing rows, the score increases exponentially with the number of rows you clear, and linearly with your current level. For example, if you’re on level 1, you will score an extra 46 points for clearing a single row. But if you clear 2 rows in one move, you will score an extra 58 points, and clearing 4 rows will earn you 202 points. Clearing 4 rows whilst on level 9 will earn you a whopping 1010 points – and that’s in addition to your block score.
