Passionate about computers from a young age, Kent started developing in BASIC on his family's Amstrad CPC 6180, which quickly led to writing Z80 assembly. His professional career has exposed him to a wide range of languages and platforms, including C#, Dart, .NET, Java, C, and F#. He's worked in a variety of sectors, including agriculture, superannuation, and finance - with both Agile and traditional Waterfall methodologies.

A [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4025178?fullName=Kent%20Cameron%20Boogaart) in Client Application Development between 2009-2018, and a [Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer](https://university.xamarin.com/certification) in 2016, Kent has been heavily involved in Xamarin development from 2012. He openly [designed and developed a complete application](https://github.com/kentcb/WorkoutWotch) for the benefit of the community, recording videos describing the process. As one of the core maintainers of the functional-reactive MVVM library, [ReactiveUI](http://reactiveui.net/), Kent authored and self-published a much-lauded [book on the subject](https://kent-boogaart.com/you-i-and-reactiveui/). Kent became very interested in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) in 2018, going on to develop several mobile applications with it, including one of his own, _Job Done_ (available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.crosslinkbs.jobdone) and [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/jobdone/id1463513891)).

Kent takes pride in his ability to communicate clearly and effectively with developers, users, and business stakeholders. He has often been complemented for bringing clarity to a previous quandary. His number one goal in any project is to delight the end user. Kent achieves this through deep thought and innovation - not satisfied until both simplicity and lucidity are attained. But at the same time a pragmatist, Kent dislikes spinning his wheels on any particular problem, preferring to return to it later once sufficient thought and context is established.
