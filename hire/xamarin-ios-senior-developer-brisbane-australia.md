In early 2012, Kent began his transition into mobile development. Intrigued by Xamarin and how it might allow him to leverage his C# skills in new areas, he threw himself head-first into the challenge. He wrote an entire application, [Workout Wotch](https://github.com/kentcb/WorkoutWotch), whilst recording the development process and publishing it on YouTube. Since then he has written many mobile applications targetting iOS via Xamarin.Forms, as well as apps targetting iOS natively with Xamarin.

In 2016, Kent became a Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer to further improve his knowledge of the mobile ecosystems.
